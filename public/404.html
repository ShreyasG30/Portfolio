  404.html

  This file provides a simple redirect to the root of the application. When a user
  refreshes a page served by a client‑side router (e.g. React Router) on
  GitHub Pages or other static hosts, the server may not understand the deep
  link and instead return a 404 error. To ensure the app continues to work
  correctly after a refresh, this HTML file immediately redirects any 404
  requests back to the root of the site where the client‑side router can take
  over and render the appropriate content.
